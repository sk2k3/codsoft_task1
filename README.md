This repository includes the first task of CodSoft Python Programming Internship, which is a command-line To-Do List using Python. This task helped me to learn and implement basic CRUD operations on arrays along with obtaining input from the user. The to-do list has the following operations: 
1. Create a new task
2. Delete a task
3. List all the available tasks
4. Quit the list
